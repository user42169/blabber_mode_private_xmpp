<h1 align="center">Welcome to the PRIVATE, modification of the blabber xmpp client</h1>

<p>
This is a modification of blabber android xmpp client which where i have removed access to gps location and contacts and moreover i hide the new messages text in notifications cuz someapps like telegram may acquire direct access to the notifications on the phone.</p>
<p>
Also i have added exported=false flag to the activities which will work on android 13+, this is necessery to prevent other apps from hijaking an activity of the app, like flag secure at a window activity.
</p>
<p>
In addition i have disabled update checking which was pingning the blabber website each time u open the app. Now this is impossible, this functional completely disabled. And u cant sent a crash report too.
</p>
<p>
Finally, i have added fingerprint feature which asking u to touch ur fingerprint sensor but only if it supported by ur android. However this function need to be upgraded, because now it not protect application. In the future i want to add password activity for protection of the app.
